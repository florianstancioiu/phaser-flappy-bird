# Phaser Flappy Bird Clone

This is an implementation of the famous flappy bird game in Phaser and JavaScript.

I coded this while following along the "[Game Development in JS/TS - The Complete Guide (w/ Phaser 3)](https://www.udemy.com/course/game-development-in-js-the-complete-guide-w-phaser-3/)" tutorial by Filip Jerga.

If you want to learn how to implement it yourself, you can purchase the course on Udemy.

**Note:** I'm using Vite instead of Webpack and made some small adjustments here and there.
